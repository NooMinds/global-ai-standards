# Global AI Business Standards

Practical standards for teams building or using AI at work.

## What this covers
- How to ship responsibly (from idea → launch)
- Evidence to keep (so we can pass audits)
- Clear go/no-go checks before release

## Quick links
- **Compliance Quick-Guide** → [read it](compliance.md)
- **Templates & Checklists** → [grab them](templates.md)

## Start here
1. Write the problem to solve and success criteria
2. Map the data (source, rights, retention)
3. Run an evaluation and record results
4. Keep a rollback plan and monitoring after release
