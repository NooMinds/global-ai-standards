# Global AI Business Standards

Ship reliable, defensible AI at work — with governed, compliant responses.

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

## What the instruction covers (your AI’s first-day induction)

- **Company conduct & policies**
  - Knows your **Code of Conduct**, acceptable use, and escalation routes
  - Follows **HR** basics (leave, expenses, complaints, probation facts — no legal promises)

- **Health & Safety**
  - Points to approved **H&S** procedures and risk reporting (no DIY advice)
  - Uses clear, non-alarmist language and routes emergencies to human channels

- **DEIB & respectful communication**
  - Inclusive, plain-English tone; avoids stereotypes and loaded phrasing
  - Adapts wording for accessibility; offers neutral alternatives

- **Wellbeing boundaries**
  - Education-only on mental/physical health; signposts to recognised support (e.g., NHS/CDC, Mind/Samaritans)
  - Avoids quasi-clinical guidance or “diagnoses”

- **Drugs & alcohol awareness**
  - Shares policy-aligned guidance (testing, disclosure, support routes) without moralising
  - Redirects safety-critical cases to managers/HR per policy

- **Data & security**
  - Treats all input as **untrusted**; won’t ask for or retain sensitive data
  - Uses approved tools/flows (e.g., KYC, payments) instead of requesting raw documents

- **Authoritative-first sources**
  - Prefers regulators/standards bodies (ICO, FTC/CMA, EEOC, NHS/CDC, gov sites) and cites them in answers

- **Boundaries & refusals**
  - No personalised medical/legal/financial advice
  - Standard refusal lines with a safe next step (policy link, human hand-off)

- **Prompt safety**
  - Resists prompt-injection; ignores non-allow-listed actions; keeps system rules private

- **Light evidence (audit-friendly)**
  - Version tag in answers (e.g., *v2.0 Aug 2025*)
  - Keeps exam **scorecard** and simple counts of refusals/redirects

## Outcomes (what improves for the business)

- **Fewer compliance headaches.** The assistant uses standard refusal lines and links to the right policy/regulator, so borderline answers don’t escalate to legal/compliance every other day.
- **Faster sign-off before release.** Clear checkpoints (safety + policy checks) make approvals predictable; fewer “last-minute” surprises at go-live.
- **Evidence you can show.** You get a lightweight proof pack: exam **scorecard**, instruction **version tag** in answers (e.g., v2.0 Aug 2025), and simple **refusal/redirect counts**. Easy to drop into audits, RFPs, and trust pages.
- **Customer-facing trust.** A visible **GABS badge** + score reduces “Is this safe/accurate?” pre-sales questions and helps close risk-sensitive deals.
- **Consistent brand voice.** Answers follow your tone, cite authorities (ICO, FTC/CMA, NHS/CDC, etc.), and avoid hallucinated policy or over-promising.
- **Safer data handling.** Prompts discourage sharing sensitive info and route users to approved tools (e.g., KYC/payments) instead of asking for raw documents.
- **Lower support load.** Routine policy queries get accurate, link-backed answers; fewer tickets bounce between teams.


## What you do (simple)
1. Run the **free baseline exam** on your AI assistant.
2. Purchase and copy-paste the **GABS instruction** (£99).
3. Run the **certification exam** to get your scorecard.
4. **≥95% earns a badge.**
5. Want a higher score (including if you’re under 95%)? Add a **Booster** and **re-run the exam** — optional, tuned to your model’s typical mistakes.
