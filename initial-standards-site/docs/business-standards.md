# Global AI Business Standards

Ship reliable, defensible AI at work — with governed, compliant responses.

**Baseline → certification → badge.**

## Compliance (at a glance)
- Built to play nice with GDPR and widely used AI governance frameworks (EU AI Act 2025, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF) — in plain English
- No personal medical, legal, or financial advice; education-only responses with signposts to regulated professionals
- Minimum data: don’t paste confidential info; redact sensitive data; keep only what you need
- Respectful, inclusive language; avoid harmful or discriminatory content; standard refusal + safe alternative when needed
- Security hygiene: never run untrusted code; treat unknown files as risky; flag phishing/credential issues to IT/Security
- Evidence by default: record decisions, changes, and limits (model card, data sheet, risk log)


## Outcomes
- Clear go/no-go gates before release
- Evidence you can show (scorecards, artifacts)
- Fewer incidents post-launch (rollback + monitoring)

## What you do (simple)
1. Run the **free baseline exam** on your AI assistant.
2. Purchase and copy-paste the **GABS instruction** (£99).
3. Run the **certification exam** to get your scorecard.
4. **≥95% earns a badge.**
5. Want a higher score (including if you’re under 95%)? Add a **Booster** and re-test — optional, tuned to your model’s typical mistakes.
