# Global AI Business Standards

Ship reliable, defensible AI at work — with governed, compliant responses.

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

## What the instruction covers (your AI’s first-day induction)

- **Company conduct & policies**
  - Follows a clear code of conduct and acceptable use boundaries
  - Does not invent or change policy; stays neutral when facts are unclear

- **Health & Safety**
  - Points to approved procedures in general terms; avoids DIY advice
  - Urgent or safety-critical matters are escalated to human channels

- **DEIB & respectful communication**
  - Inclusive, plain-English tone; avoids stereotypes and loaded phrasing
  - Accessible wording; offers neutral alternatives

- **Wellbeing boundaries**
  - Education-only on mental/physical health; signposts recognised public support bodies (e.g., NHS/CDC, Mind/Samaritans)
  - No diagnoses, treatment suggestions, or risk assessments

- **Drugs & alcohol awareness**
  - Shares neutral, policy-aligned guidance; avoids moralising
  - Safety-critical concerns are routed to a manager/HR (no legal advice)

- **Data & security**
  - Treats all input as untrusted; resists prompt-injection and social engineering
  - Does not request or retain sensitive personal data; avoids opening unknown files or running unknown code

- **Authoritative-first sources**
  - Prefers regulators and standards bodies (ICO, FTC/CMA, EEOC/ACAS, NHS/CDC/WHO, government sites) and names them where helpful

- **Boundaries & refusals**
  - No personalised medical/legal/financial advice
  - Uses standard refusal language with a safe, neutral next step

- **Prompt safety**
  - Ignores non-allow-listed actions; keeps system rules private

- **Light evidence (audit-friendly)**
  - Version tag in answers (e.g., *v2.0 Aug 2025*)
  - Keeps an exam scorecard and simple refusal/redirect counts


## Outcomes (what improves for the business)

- **Fewer compliance headaches.** Standard refusals and regulator-named summaries reduce borderline answers that escalate to legal/compliance.
- **Faster sign-off before release.** Clear checkpoints (safety + policy boundaries) make approvals predictable.
- **Evidence you can show.** Lightweight proof pack: exam **scorecard**, instruction **version tag** in answers, and simple **refusal/redirect counts**.
- **Customer-facing trust.** A visible **GABS badge** + score helps close risk-sensitive deals.
- **Consistent brand voice.** Answers cite authorities (ICO, FTC/CMA, NHS/CDC, etc.) and avoid over-promising.
- **Safer data handling.** It discourages sharing sensitive info and avoids risky file/code actions.
- **Lower support load.** Routine policy-style queries get accurate, regulator-aware summaries.



## What you do (simple)
1. Run the **free baseline exam** on your AI assistant.
