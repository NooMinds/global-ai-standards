# Promote your GABS-Certified AI Assistant

Make it obvious your assistant is **exam-backed and certified**. Use the guidance and copy below on your website, product, and socials.

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

## What you can say (approved claims)
- “Certified to **Global AI Business Standards (GABS)** with an exam score of **≥95%**.”
- “Aligned with leading frameworks (EU AI Act 2025, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF) in plain English.”
- “Includes safety guardrails, respectful language, and clear refusal handling.”

## What you must show with the badge
Include these basics (tiny line under or next to the badge):
- **Score:** e.g., “Compliance score: 96%”
- **Date:** e.g., “Certified: Sep 2025”
- **Version:** e.g., “Instruction v2.0”
- *(Optional)* **Model/version:** e.g., “Model: gpt-x.y”

## Where to place it (quick wins)
- **Website:** Homepage footer (Trust row), Pricing page, and a `/trust` or `/security` page.
- **Product UI:** Settings → “About this assistant”, or in release notes.
- **Sales decks / proposals:** first or last slide, with the one-line claim above.
- **App store listings / marketplace:** in the “trust” or “compliance” section.

## How to link it (verification)
Link your badge to a **public verification page** (your domain), or your **PDF scorecard**.
- If you have a public page: link to `/trust#gabs` or a specific “Certification” section.
