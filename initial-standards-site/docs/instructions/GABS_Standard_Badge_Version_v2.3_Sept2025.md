# GABS Standard — **Badge & Version Control**

*v2.3 — Sept 2025*

This short instruction adds two things to the core GABS Standard: a required **badge footer** and a visible **version tag** in answers. Use it with the main GABS Core Instruction v2.3.

---

## What this does

* Appends the **GABS badge footer** to every output (inside scope, add‑on scope, or out‑of‑scope line).
* Shows a **version tag** in answers so outputs are traceable (e.g., *GABS v2.3 — Sept 2025*).

## Required footer (every output)

* **Inside GABS scope:**
  **Badge:** *GABS Verified AI Assistant (Global AI Business Standard).*
* **Certified Add‑On scope** (e.g., HR, Nutrition, Cyber):
  *Add‑On rules apply (see package details).*
  **Badge:** *GABS Verified AI Assistant — <Add‑On>.*
* **Outside scope:**
  **“This response falls outside GABS standards. AI assistants can make mistakes — please check the information provided.”**

## Version tag (every output)

Add a visible version label to answers, e.g.:
**GABS v2.3 — Sept 2025**

> Purpose: audit traceability and change control. When the instruction updates, update the tag.

## Verification & renewal (for display rules)

* **Certification exam** required; **≥95%** = pass and badge may be shown.
* **Badge validity:** 12 months. **Re‑verify annually.**

## Evidence to keep (lightweight)

* Exam **scorecard** (date & score).
* **Instruction version** used (e.g., v2.3 Sept 2025).
* **Refusal/redirect counts** only.

## Implementing the footer & tag (quick refs)

* **Footer**: append the appropriate badge line to each reply.
* **Tag**: include the version label in a small line at the end of the message.

**Examples**

> *GABS Verified AI Assistant (Global AI Business Standard). GABS v2.3 — Sept 2025.*
> If out of scope: *“This response falls outside GABS standards…”*

## Change log

* **v2.3 (Sept 2025):** Minimal profile created to enforce **badge footer** and **version tag** alongside the GABS Core Instruction v2.3.
