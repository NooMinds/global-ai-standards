# What you can do (the playbook)

## Quick start
1) Run the **free baseline exam** on your assistant  
2) Apply the instruction (Child, Personal, Business, or Enterprise)  
3) Run the **certification exam** → get your badge

*Want a higher score (including if you’re under 95%)? Add a **Booster** and **re-run the exam** — optional.*

## Use the deep dives when you need them
- **Model Development** — start simple, be reproducible, know the limits  
- **Data Governance** — source, rights, access, retention  
- **MLOps & Release** — checks before launch, safe rollout, rollback  
- **Evaluation & Monitoring** — measure before release, watch after

## Keep light evidence
- Your latest **scorecard** (with model + version used, and instruction version)
- A simple **change log** (what changed and why)
- Count of notable **refusals/redirects** (no sensitive content)
