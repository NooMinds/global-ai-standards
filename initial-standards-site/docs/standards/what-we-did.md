# What we did (how the standards were set)

## Principles
- Accurate, compliant, safe — in that order.
- Plain-English rules that real teams can follow.

## Sources & alignment
- Aligned to major frameworks: **EU AI Act (2025)**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, **NIST AI RMF**, and relevant regional guidance.
- Child, Personal, Business, Enterprise mapped to the right parts of those frameworks.

## Exams & scoring
- Baseline exam → apply instruction → certification exam.
- Clear thresholds with **critical-fail** rules for unsafe behaviour.
- Scorecards show pass/fail and context (model, version, instruction version).

## Update cycle
- Standards reviewed regularly; changes versioned (e.g., v2.0 Aug 2025).
- Enterprises get **API updates** during the year; badges renewed annually.

## Verification & badges
- **≥95%** earns a badge.
- Badges expire after **12 months**; re-exam to renew.
