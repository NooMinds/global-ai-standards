# Global AI Subject Instruction Packs

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

Plug-in add-ons that layer domain rules on top of your chosen standard (Child, Personal, Business or Enterprise). Faster than custom work, lighter than full policy rewrites.

Teams and individuals who want **expert-tuned subject packs to match their business or personal needs** — without going fully custom.

## What you get

- **Safety & compliance guardrails** for the topic (plain-English, exam-aligned)
- **Example tasks + checks** to prove it works in your context
- **Refusal language & tone** tailored to the subject (respectful, inclusive)
- **Version tag & update notes** so you know what changed and when
