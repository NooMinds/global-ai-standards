# About Global AI Standards (GAS)

GAS is the single source of truth for AI standards across our org — practical, auditable, and easy to use.

- Bake in compliance with **EU AI Act (2025)**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, and **NIST AI RMF**.

- **GACS** — compliance controls & audits
- **GABS** — assistant behaviour standards
- **GABS (Enterprise)** — audit packs & consultations
