# Global AI Custom Consultation

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

Your one-off, bespoke instruction for your AI assistant — tailored to your brand, tasks, tone, and risk profile.

## What this is
- A single, client-specific instruction set built from your policies and voice
- **Exclusive use:** not copied, resold, or reused for any other business
- Optional **Enterprise** alignment (API updates + audit logging) if you use GABS Enterprise

## What you get
- Bespoke instruction (copy-paste) + a quick post-build tune
- Validation: baseline vs certification **exam** with a scorecard
- Handoff pack: version tag, short change log, and a re-exam guide

## How it works
1. 30-minute intake (goals, examples, constraints)
2. Draft → review together → refine
3. Apply the instruction and run the certification **exam**
4. **≥95% earns a badge.** Want higher? Add a **Booster** and **re-run the exam** (optional)
5. Optional support blocks: implementation help or extra tuning

## Assurances
- **Exclusivity:** your instruction is unique to you and not reused elsewhere
- **Confidentiality:** we only use information you share for this engagement
- **Alignment:** GDPR-first with EU AI Act / ISO/IEC 42001 / NIST AI RMF mapping in plain English
