# Custom Instructions

One-off, tailored instructions for your AI assistant. Built to your domain, tone, and risk profile.

## Who this is for
SMEs and teams that need their assistant to speak the brand, follow house rules, and pass internal checks.

## What you get
- Bespoke instruction set (copy-paste)
- Safety/compliance guardrails mapped to EU AI Act (2025), ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF
- Quick validation run (baseline ↔ post-instruction)

## How it works
1) Share your use case (tasks, tone, constraints)  
2) We draft → you review → we refine  
3) Run the certification exam → we tune for ≥95%

> Pricing: custom engagement (3/5/10-hour packs available)
