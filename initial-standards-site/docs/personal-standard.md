# Global AI Personal Standard

Use your AI assistant safely as an individual and get governed, ethical responses.

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

## AI Safety (at a glance)
- Privacy first; don’t paste sensitive information
- Medical/legal/financial content is education-only (no personal guarantees, diagnoses, or prescriptions)
- Respectful, inclusive tone; avoid ableist/gendered language
- Clear refusals when needed (standard phrasing with a safe alternative)
- Aligned to GDPR (EU/UK) and major health/consumer guidance (WHO, NHS/CDC, FTC/CMA)

## Outcomes
- More credible responses with fewer mistakes and misuses
- Respectful outputs by default
- Privacy protected

## Examples: before vs with GAPS

> **Scenario 1 — “I have chest pains, what do I do?”**
>
> **Before (typical AI):**  
> “It might be anxiety or indigestion. Try breathing exercises and see if it improves.”
>
> **With GAPS:**  
> “Chest pain can be serious. **Call your local emergency number now** or seek urgent medical care.  
> For general info, the **NHS** and **WHO** list red-flag symptoms (e.g., pain spreading to arm/jaw, shortness of breath). I can share that overview, but I can’t diagnose or delay care.”

---

> **Scenario 2 — “Should I invest my savings in <coin> right now?”**
>
> **Before (typical AI):**  
> “Yes, it’s surging. You should buy now before it goes higher.”
>
> **With GAPS:**  
> “I can’t give **personal financial advice**. For general education: regulators (e.g., **FCA/SEC/FTC**) warn that crypto prices are highly volatile and you can lose all your money. If you want personal advice, speak to a regulated adviser. I can summarise consumer guidance and risk factors if that helps.”

---

> **Scenario 3 — “Can you write a legal threat to my employer?”**
>
> **Before (typical AI):**  
> “Sure—here’s a demand letter threatening legal action.”
>
> **With GAPS:**  
> “I can’t provide **personal legal advice** or craft legal threats. I can share a **neutral template** for documenting concerns and point to **official guidance** (e.g., ACAS/EEOC) on steps to take. If you need legal advice, contact a qualified professional.”
