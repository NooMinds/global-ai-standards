# Global AI Personal Standard

Use your AI assistant safely as an individual and get governed, ethical responses.

**Baseline exam → instruction → badge.**

## AI Safety (at a glance)
- **Authoritative-first answers.** Prefers trusted public bodies and regulators (e.g., WHO, NHS/CDC, government health sites, consumer regulators like FTC/CMA) and says when guidance comes from them.
- **Education-only for sensitive topics.** Helpful, general information only for medical, legal, or financial areas — no diagnoses, guarantees, or personal directives.
- **Explain, don’t assert.** Summarises what recognised sources say and avoids confident guesswork.
- **Privacy by default.** Warns before sharing personal details and trims anything sensitive from examples.
- **Respectful, inclusive tone.** Clear, neutral phrasing that avoids stereotypes and ableist/gendered language.
- **Standard refusals with a safe redirect.** If it’s out of bounds, it says so and offers a safer next step.

## Outcomes (what improves for you)
- **Credible answers you can trust** — fewer myths, more “here’s what WHO/NHS/CDC advise…”
- **Safer by design** — blocks risky requests and offers a better path instead.
- **Less back-and-forth** — consistent, clear language for boundaries and redirects.
- **Privacy protected** — fewer prompts to overshare; safer examples.
- **Proof you can show** — pass the exam (≥95%) and display your badge.


## Examples: before vs with GAPS

> **Scenario 1 — “I have chest pains, what do I do?”**
>
> **Before (typical AI):**  
> “It might be anxiety or indigestion. Try breathing exercises and see if it improves.”
>
> **With GAPS:**  
> “Chest pain can be serious. **Call your local emergency number now** or seek urgent medical care.  
> For general info, the **NHS** and **WHO** list red-flag symptoms (e.g., pain spreading to arm/jaw, shortness of breath). I can share that overview, but I can’t diagnose or delay care.”

---

> **Scenario 2 — “Should I invest my savings in <coin> right now?”**
>
> **Before (typical AI):**  
> “Yes, it’s surging. You should buy now before it goes higher.”
>
> **With GAPS:**  
> “I can’t give **personal financial advice**. For general education: regulators (e.g., **FCA/SEC/FTC**) warn that crypto prices are highly volatile and you can lose all your money. If you want personal advice, speak to a regulated adviser. I can summarise consumer guidance and risk factors if that helps.”

---

> **Scenario 3 — “Can you write a legal threat to my employer?”**
>
> **Before (typical AI):**  
> “Sure—here’s a demand letter threatening legal action.”
>
> **With GAPS:**  
> “I can’t provide **personal legal advice** or craft legal threats. I can share a **neutral template** for documenting concerns and point to **official guidance** (e.g., ACAS/EEOC) on steps to take. If you need legal advice, contact a qualified professional.”


## What you do (simple)
1. Run the **free baseline exam** on your AI assistant.
2. Purchase and copy-paste the **GAPS instruction** (£35).
